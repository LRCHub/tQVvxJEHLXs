# Alohaii – What Are The Odds

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I've started to build my life in a fortress
A mountain of pillows to keep me safe
My comforter sealing off the entrance
A beautiful lonely place (mhm)

Oh, what are the odds a tremor
From your wake would shift the ground?
I reinforce the walls, clock ticking
As my time is running out
I hear that sound

I wish that I spent more time being honest
When telling the truth could still feel safe
But expectations killed that option
My fingers were crossed anyway

It's always one step forward (ooh)
Then it's two steps back, I fall right off a cliff side
If I break my cover (ooh)
You could break it all in an instant

Oh, what are the odds my hands would be
The ones to tear this down?
Oh, blankets raining down, I'm drowning
As the cloth covers my mouth
There's no sound

So, tell me
Oh, what are the odds?
Oh, what are the odds?
Oh, what are the odds?
Oh, what are the odds?

Your voice, so far away from inside
Your message sinks and drowns in the knitted tide
'Cause what kind of person would I be?
If I let you hurt me?
If I let you see into my room, the walls would break in an instant

Oh, what are the odds?
Oh, what are the odds?
Oh, what are the odds?
Oh, what are the odds?
